## Motivation

The motivation of this project is to replicate the results found in the paper [Communication-Efficient Learning of Deep Networks from Decentralized data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629). The results were then compared using different scheduling
protocols. These include random schduling, and a form of age based scheduling. 

## The Dataset

### Independent & Identically Distributed Case

The results that were replicated were done using the MNIST dataset in two different cases. As described in the paper the IID case calls for splitting the dataset up by first shuffling the data and then splitting it up evenly to the 100
clients. This gives each client 600 samples to train on. This allows each client to have an equal chance to get data from each class.

### Non-Independent & Identically Distributed Case


## Results

Describe the results or outcomes of the project. Include any findings, insights, or conclusions obtained from the work.
